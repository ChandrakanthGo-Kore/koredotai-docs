Kore.ai XO Platform supports integration with the Nice inContact Agent System to hand over the conversations without having to use the BotKit.

Please visit Deploy → Channels → Nice inContact → Configurations to manage Nice inContact.

After you have successfully established a connection with Zoom Contact Center, the Kore.ai XO platform moves the Nice inContact agent system into the configured state. No additional configuration is required.
