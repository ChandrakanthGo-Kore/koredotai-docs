## XO GPT Policy Guidelines

By the use of the Generative AI features of the Product using Large Language Models Product, you agree to all the applicable terms and conditions detailed out below. These terms and conditions are to be read along with any applicable General Terms and Conditions detailed at https://kore.ai/terms-of-service/

**Fine-tuned Models**: In addition to incorporating commercially available models, we are introducing Koreâ€™s fine-tuned large language models that have been carefully trained to perform specific language tasks. These models are built upon open-source foundational models and have undergone a fine-tuning process to enhance their capabilities. However, it's important to note that while Kore has taken extensive measures to ensure the appropriateness of the generated content, we cannot guarantee that the models will exclusively produce suitable outputs in all instances.

**Enterprise Responsibility**: It is the responsibility of enterprises utilizing fine-tuned models to thoroughly assess and monitor the generated content to ensure its accuracy, appropriateness, and adherence to ethical standards. Despite our efforts to enhance the models' behaviour, the variability of language and context means that there might be occasional instances where the generated content may not meet expectations. Kore cannot be held liable for any such content that might not align with your intended use case.
Quality Assurance: Enterprises are advised to implement robust quality assurance processes to review and validate the content generated by the fine-tuned models. This practice will help identify and rectify any discrepancies, inaccuracies, or content that may deviate from the desired outcome.

**Transparency**: We value transparency and the ethical use of Generative AI technologies. To that end, we reserve the right to monitor the usage of these features to ensure they are being used responsibly and within the guidelines. We also reserve the right to disable or modify any portions of the Generative AI technologies at any time to prevent any misuse or abuse.

**Misuse**: Misuse of the fine-tuned models, including but not limited to usage for harmful or illegal activities, is not permitted. Users suspected or found to be in violation of the applicable policies as modified from time to time with or without prior written notice, will be subject to immediate account suspension or termination. You will be legally liable for breaching any local laws and/or regulations.

**Continuous Improvement**: We are committed to continuously improving the fine-tuned models and policies to ensure their responsible use. Please share any feedback or concerns you may have with our team. As a part of this continuous improvement, we reserve the right to modify these models and policies at any time, with or without prior written notice of such changes.

**Mitigation of Unintended Content**: While our aim is to minimize such occurrences, there might be instances where the fine-tuned models produce content that is unintended or inappropriate. Enterprises should have mechanisms in place to swiftly address and rectify any such situations to prevent any negative impact.

**Legal and Regulatory Compliance**: In alignment with the original policy guidelines, enterprises must ensure that their usage of fine-tuned models complies with all relevant legal and regulatory requirements applicable in their jurisdiction.

**Indemnification**: Enterprises acknowledge and accept the responsibility to indemnify Kore against any claims, liabilities, or damages arising from the use of the fine-tuned models, as specified in the original policy guidelines.

By adhering to these additional guidelines, enterprises demonstrate their commitment to utilizing the fine-tuned models responsibly and proactively managing any potential challenges that may arise during the content generation process.
